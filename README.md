# SeqDivFuzz

This repository contains data and code for the paper **Fuzzing with Sequence Diversity Inference for Sequential Decision-making Model Testing**.



## Overview

We propose an optimized fuzzing framework **SeqDivFuzz** integrating sequence diversity inference to boost efficiency for testing sequential decision-making model.

We make experimental evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency of SeqDivFuzz with **four models** involving **three simulation environments** with promising performance, outperforming the SOTA baseline.

The overall structure is shown in the figure below:
